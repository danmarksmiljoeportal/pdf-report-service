# Visibility Control with `hidden-paragraph` and `validate-rule` Classes

This implementation involves two classes that determine whether a section should be displayed based on the content inside a child element.

## HTML Structure

```html
<div class="hidden-paragraph">
    <span>Report commissioned by </span>
    <span class="validate-rule">{$AUTHOR}</span>
</div>
```
## Explanation
- `hidden-paragraph`: This parent class controls the visibility of the entire section. It determines whether the section should be shown or hidden based on the content inside its child elements.

- `validate-rule`: This child class contains dynamic content, such as `{$AUTHOR}`. If this content is empty or not present, the entire section (i.e., the element with the `hidden-paragraph` class) should be hidden from view.
